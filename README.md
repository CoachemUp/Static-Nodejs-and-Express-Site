# Static-Nodejs-and-Express-Site
FSJS 6
In this project, I created a gorgeous portfolio site to showcase the my projects that I've built. The site contains a modern landing page, an about page, and a series of project pages to show off and detail my projects from this Techdegree.

I create a JSON file to store all the data about the projects I've created.

I used Pug to complete provided templates that utilize the JSON to generate the markup that is ultimately displayed in the browser.

I used Node.js and Express to:

    --Import the required dependencies
    --Link the JSON with the Pug templates
    --Set up routes to handle requests
    --Set up the middleware to utilize static files like CSS
    --Handle errors
    --Set up a server to serve the project

3 design customizations

    --changed headings to italicized
    --changed .box background to gray
    --changed font color for project names
