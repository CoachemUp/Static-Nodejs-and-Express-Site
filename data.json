I started with a file that contains information for 42 students, including name, email, and picture. I had to use JavaScript to display the first nine students on the page. Then I added navigation, also known as pagination buttons, that the user can click to display different pages of students. The application had to work with a list of any number of students, not just with the supplied array of 42 students. The solution needed to be flexible enough to handle arrays of student data of various lengths.",

Click Start Game button to display a gameboard with a random phrase. Click the on-screen keyboard to guess a letter in the phrase. If you you choose an incorrect letter, you will lose a heart/life. You have 5 chances to miss until you lose the game. After the game is over, click Start Game button to play a new game.",

They need a smart way for employees to share contact information with each other. I used the Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/) to grab information for 12 random “employees,” and used that data to build a prototype for an Awesome Startup employee directory. I requested a JSON object from the API and parse the data so that 12 employees are listed in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location. Clicking the employees image or name will open a modal window with more detailed information, such as the employees birthday and address. Frameworks, libraries or plugins were not used. This was all custom JS to create the necessary functionality for this project. This project will demonstrate working with public APIs, making API requests, and asynchronously handling the data that will be returned from your requests and displayed in an app. A search feature has been added so that students can be filtered by name.",
